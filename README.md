This is my sandbox, a place for code that isn't substantial enough to live in a
dedicated project repository. It contains a substantial portion of code from
some of my oldest projects and learning exercises.

If you find something useful here, it is all [Unlicensed](LICENSE). Note however
that the majority is experimental, untested and undocumented.
